This is essentially my first project I made in javascript. The objective was to get familiar with functions, values and other fundamental aspects of JS. There are definitely improvements to be made to the game itself, but as the objective was learning, I moved on when the code I was writing started feeling repetative. 

If I would make this project again I would implement some kind of grid to further distinguish the pieces and implement more of the ECMAscript 5 features.
